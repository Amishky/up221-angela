## Profile
I'm a second-year urban planning design and development student. I also work for the City of West Hollywood as a Long Range Planner. Outside of school and work, I love spending time with my two cats, Piglet and Duchess, and am currently completing a 200-hour yoga teacher certification training. 

## Planning Interests and Course Objectives
I'm primarily interested in data science, economic development, and public space design and would ideally complete a final project that combines the three. I am really excited by the potential of large datasets to reveal phenomena that may not have been accessible in the past, and I hope this course provides me with the skills to articulate such data well.
